**How to analysis**

To get started: install R (You might have to install newer or older versions, depending on your operating system) and Rstudio on your computer.

To use: Paste blocks of code into Rstudio and execute them. It also might help to paste them into a new ".R" file and then you can highlight and run specific blocks of code with the "Run" button or cmd+Enter keys.

Base R information can be found here https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf
or by entering the following into an R console:

install.packages("swirl")

library(swirl)

swirl()

**Some assembly may be required.**
